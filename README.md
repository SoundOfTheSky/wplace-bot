## Known issues

1. Sometimes "Draw" doesn't place pixels. But if you click on another tab, come back and click only on "Draw" it should work. I don't know what's wrong but fix should come soon.
2. It's hard to align images. For now draw two corners beforehand for easy alignment.
3. Bot doesn't know what pixels are already drawn.

## Help wanted

We need a way to read map's position and zoom to fix issues 2 and 3.
